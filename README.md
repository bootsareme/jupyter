# Jupyter Notebooks
A collection of original Jupyter notebooks authored by me. These notebooks are completely authentic and are the results of original research conducted by me. Please check the license file and give me appropriate credit if you use these notebooks. I will regularly update this repository if I author new Jupyter Notebooks. If another work is used in my notebook, citations will be provided within the notebook itself.

## Datasets
