# Jupyter Notebooks
A collection of original Jupyter notebooks authored by me. These notebooks are completely authentic and are the results of original research conducted by me. Please check the license file and give me appropriate credit if you use these notebooks. I will regularly update this repository if I author new Jupyter Notebooks. No notebook in this repository is a direct clone of another individual's work.

## Datasets
All datasets referenced in the Jupyter Notebooks are located in the [datasets](datasets) folder. To see more information in regards to the datasets, please read the [README.MD](datasets/README.md).
