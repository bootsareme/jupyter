# Jupyter Notebooks
A collection of original Jupyter notebooks authored by me. These notebooks are completely authentic and are the results of original research conducted by me. No notebook in this repository is a direct clone of another individual's work. Please check the license file and give me appropriate credit if you use these notebooks. I will regularly update this repository if I author new Jupyter Notebooks. All notebooks will contain sample output that is ran on a Python Kernel on a local environment. Some libraries included in the notebook may be missing for you and therefore may need installation. 

## Raw & Structured Data 
All data (both raw and structured datasets) referenced in the Jupyter Notebooks are located in the [notebooks/data](notebooks/data) folder. This is for your convenience as when you clone the repository, all the relative directory references stated in the notebooks are preserved. Assuming the dataset does not appear in the table below, all data presented in the `data` folder linked above is collected by me. More information on the data collection process will be described within each individual notebook. If the data was pulled from external sources, they will appear in the table below.
